            Founded on the principle of reducing exploitation, we aspire, above
            all else, to be fair to people both within and outside the company
            as we conduct our business. People are at the heart of Sahaj, and
            reflected in our ethos of trust and respect. We maintain high
            standards of integrity and our employees are always treated with
            respect regardless of their identity. We strongly proscribe the evil
            practices of human trafficking, forced labour, and other
            manifestations of modern slavery, and do not indulge in them. To
            that end, we enforce transparency in our business and ensure that
            our external suppliers also do not indulge in any manifestation of
            modern slavery. As a growing business, we are committed to be in
            compliance with this.
